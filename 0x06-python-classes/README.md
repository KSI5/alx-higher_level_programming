This README file provides the description of the 0x06-python-classes tasks.


#0x06-python-classes


**0-square.py:** 
This file contains the implementation of a basic Square class with a private instance attribute `size`. It demonstrates the concept of a class and the instantiation of objects.

**1-square.py:** 
In this task, the Square class is updated to include a private instance attribute `size` and an optional size parameter in the constructor. It introduces error handling for non-integer sizes.

**2-square.py:** 
The Square class is enhanced with a public instance method `area()` that calculates and returns the area of the square based on its size.

**3-square.py:** 
This task extends the Square class by adding properties for retrieving and setting the `size` attribute. The properties enforce type and value validation for the size attribute.

**4-square.py:** 
The Square class is further improved with the addition of a private instance attribute `position` and corresponding properties for accessing and modifying it. The position attribute represents the position of the square when printed.

**5-square.py:** 
In this task, the Square class gains a public instance method `my_print()` that prints a square using the '#' character. The method takes into account the size and position of the square.

**6-square.py**
Updates the Square class with additional functionality: square instance can answer to comparators: ==, !=, >, >=, <, and <= based on the square area.

**100-singly_linked_list.py**
Defines a class Node that represents a node in a singly-linked list. It also defines a class SinglyLinkedList that represents a singly-linked list.

**101-square.py**
Updates the Square class from 6-square.py with a new private instance attribute position. It also updates the my_print() method to print the square with the # character using the position attribute.

**102-square.py**
Updates the Square class with a new method __repr__() to provide a string representation of the square for debugging purposes.

**103-magic_class.py**
Defines a class MagicClass that represents a circle. It has methods to calculate the area and circumference of the circle.
